            <img alt="Yoga" src="slideshow/Yoga&meditation.png" title="Yoga" />

            <p>Yoga is a physical exercise that involves different body poses, breathing techniques, and meditation. The
                therapy may help with depression and your symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating or loss of energy.
            </p>
            <p>Many people use yoga therapy to manage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>mental and emotional problems, such as stress, anxiety, or depression</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>conditions and disorders, such as ongoing low back pain</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>chronic or long-term pain</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>overall health and well-being</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>To improve mood and relaxation</h2>
            <p>Like exercise, yoga is a natural way to increase serotonin production. Serotonin production plays a role
                in the treatment of depression. Serotonin is believed to play a major role in happiness. Yoga is also
                especially helpful because of its gentle, calming, and fluid nature. Each pose is flexible, so people of
                all levels can practice. Your instructor will emphasize breathing, concentration, and smooth movement.
                Theyâ€™ll also encourage you to focus on positive images to calm the body and mind.</p>

            <h2>To reduce stress and anxiety</h2>
            <p>Yoga also increases your heart rate variability (HRV), or change in time between heart beats, by
                increasing the relaxation response over the stress response in the body. A high HRV means that your body
                is better at self-monitoring or adapting, particularly to stress.</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Yoga can also:</p>
                <li>
                    <p>reduce resting heart rate</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>lower blood pressure</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>ease breathing</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>increase pain tolerance</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
