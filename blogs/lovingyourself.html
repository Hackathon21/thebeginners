            <h1>LOVING YOURSELF</h1>

            <p>All too often we find people scrunching up their nose at the mention of self-love, as if it’s a bit
                cheesy and self-indulgent. But learning to love yourself is one of the most powerful and important
                things you can do in life. Your heart is your power and when you become the source of love in your own
                life it changes everything. Your relationships, your career, your health – they all flourish when you
                start to love yourself.
            </p>
            <p><b>Know yourself.</b>It’s impossible to love yourself if you don’t even know who you are. Invest in
                discovering what you believe, value, and like.
            </p>

            <p><b>Say “no” when you need to.</b>Boundaries are an essential form of self-care because they let others
                know that you deserve and expect respect.</p>

            <p><b>Don’t compare yourself to others.</b>Others aren’t better or worse, more or less than you; They’re
                just different. You have value just as you are and accepting yourself means there’s no need for
                comparisons.</p>
            <p><b>Be truly present.</b>Our lives are full of distractions. Many of these things are fun and worthwhile,
                but they can be draining and keep us from truly knowing and being ourselves.</p>

            <p><b>Know and use your strengths.</b>We all have tremendous gifts, but many of them go unnoticed. When
                you’re busy and distracted it’s hard to access these great qualities. Focusing on your strengths will
                increase your positive feelings for yourself.</p>
            <p><b>Give yourself a treat.</b>A treat is something special that you just give yourself. Unlike a reward,
                it doesn’t have to be earned. Be good to yourself by giving yourself treats “just because”.
            </p>
            <p><b>Be honest with yourself.</b>This one can be harder than it seems. Some of us as so good at
                self-deception that we don’t even know we’re doing it. Honesty is key in all relationships and your
                relationship with yourself is no different. Clearly, you can’t love your entire messy self if you’re
                lying, minimizing, or making excuses. True self-love means taking responsibility and accountability.ि
            </p>
            <p><b>Let yourself off the hook for your mistakes and imperfections.</b>You’re hard on yourself. You’re
                probably harder on yourself than anybody else. Cut yourself some slack and embrace your humanness.
                Mistakes are normal. Imperfections are part of what makes you, you. </p>
