            <p>This free time presents us with opportunities to do things which we’ve always wanted to do or like to do
                more of depending on our individual circumstances. I think it makes sense for us to be productive with
                this time and do things that are meaningful to us.</p>
            <p>Here are a number of productive activities which you can undertake.</p>

            <h2>READ THAT BOOK (SERIES) YOU’VE BEEN PUTTING OFF</h2>
            <p>Books exercise the brain, build our vocabularies, lowers stress and also enhances the imagination.
                Whether you prefer fiction or non-fiction, buy yourself some books and start reading more this week.
            </p>

            <h2>WATCH A DOCUMENTARY SERIES ON NETFLIX</h2>
            <p>You may choose to watch a documentary series on Netflix which you have never taken an interest in before,
                which is great.</p>

            <h2>KEEP A BLOG/JOURNAL</h2>
            <p>Keeping track of your thoughts, activities and learnings is always a good idea - and a highly productive
                one at that. You might look back at this time and process your memories or even process your thoughts
                for the day or the week that has passed.
            </p>

            <h2>ENROL ON A FREE COURSE</h2>
            <p>Enrolling on a course and successfully passing tests and assignments will help build up your
                knowledge-base as well as your CV. The Open University, for example, offers a wide range of
                foundation-level courses for anyone to enrol for free and start learning from their catalogue of courses
                from history and the arts to society, politics and law.
            </p>

            <h2>ET UP A WORKOUT ROUTINE</h2>
            <p>You actually don’t even need such equipment if you follow some of the workout videos available on
                YouTube.</p>

            <h2>COMPLETE A DAILY PUZZLE!</h2>
            <p>Another great way to get the mind working first thing. Like reading books, solving puzzles offer a range
                of benefits: Improved memory, better problem-solving skills and increased IQ are just some of them. This
                sort of brain training can take many forms, such as jigsaws, Sudoku puzzles or crosswords which can be
                found/purchased easily and cheaply.
            </p>

            <h2>MEDITATE</h2>
            <p>It’s important to be mindful of your surroundings as well as your wellbeing whilst in quarantine, and
                meditation might help you get a bit of peace of mind in times of uncertainty Aura and Headspace both
                offer help if you are new to meditation and mindfulness.
            </p>

            <h2>KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS</h2>
            <p>We’re isolated from the people we usually spend time with but we can be connected with them via more
                means more than ever before. Make time to catch-up and have a virtual drink with your friends and
                family. Use the time to speak to relatives that you might not have spoken to in a while - maybe look to
                find out via those family members about great-great-grandparents who lived through wars as well as
                pandemics.
            </p>

            <h2>CATCH UP ON YOUR SLEEP</h2>
            <p>Those early mornings and late nights that make up our usual routines sometimes take their toll on us.
                During this period own increased downtime, be sure to sleep enough. Undertaking some of the activities
                on this list will help you sleep naturally, but ensure that you are going to bed at a reasonable time
